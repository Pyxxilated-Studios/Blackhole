Blackhole is a DNS filtering server. It acts as your DNS server, and will filter out requests that match criteria that
the user specifies.

- [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/)

### Why Blackhole

The above all have something that the others do not (or, if it does exist, it requires some very manual tuning).
Currently, Blackhole is only able to cover a fraction of any of these on its own. However, to see what it is planning on
handling, check out the Issues page.

<!-- Should probably put an actual roadmap somewhere -->
